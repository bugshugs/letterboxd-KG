Bird Box is decent. The first act is good, the second is a bit worse and I honestly didn‚Äôt vibe with the third one.

it gave us real feels, feels I‚Äôd sometimes rather not have (which is a good thing)
it gave us gay freaking nazis, that‚Äôs some real representation¬†
it gave us amazing writing and cinematography
it gave us hitler eating a unicorn
it gave us an insight in propaganda and how it affects us all, and that‚Äôs something everyone can take away from it

Sadly, this all gets negated for me bc the movie just never managed to get me hooked at all. Things were happening on screen but I stayed completely apathetic though all of it. I realised when the movie wanted me to feel tense bc of the really fitting and good soundtrack, I just never got invested in the characters, so I didn‚Äôt care about what was happening to them.

2022-02-16,Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,2016,https://boxd.it/2AhW3r,4,,"oof, that was an experience. I kinda loved it tho

I went into this knowing the kind of hate this movie, Snyder and the DCEU in general are getting, and you know, after Man of Steel I ‚Äûkinda‚Äú understood it. Man of Steel was an interchangeable, Michael Bay-esque city destruction movie where nothing had any real consequences. Needless to say, I was extremely positively surprised to see that Snyder went on to address all that in the sequel.
Batman vs Superman is good. I actually happen to love this take on Batman, a bit rugged and rough on the edges, but still believes in his own moral superiority. I think it‚Äôs a logical evolution from the the previous versions we‚Äôve seen on screen without loosing the core of the character. And I also happen to love the dilemma of how a god-like being like Superman could possibly fit into a human society. Where the movie falls short a bit, in my opinion, is how it concludes those storylines. The infamous ‚ÄûMartha‚Äú scene wasn‚Äôt the best decision, granted, but apart from that part I think the movie does a pretty good job. I was genuinely invested in the characters in the end, something that I cannot say about Man of Steel.

‚Ä¢) Sherlock had a really satisfying and believable character development arc after being pretty stale for the first 2 seasons, which I really enjoyed.

what‚Äôs negative about this:

‚Ä¢) Moriarty has been an unimportant afterthought for 2 whole seasons now, could‚Äôve left him out altogether.

‚Ä¢) EVERYTHING MARY WATSON RELATED PAST S3E2 OMG I HATE HATE HATE THE MARY PLOTLINE SO SO MUCH. I guess it could‚Äôve been okay if it was just s3e3 but to twist everything we previously learned AGAIN in the next episode just makes me appreciate all the moments of the earlier episodes less. Like, for example, John Watson burning Mary‚Äòs hard drive because he decides not to care for her past ONLY FOR THE NEXT EPISODE TO BRING THE HARD DRIVE BACK ANYWAY. AAAHRG. The Mary plotline will forever be my pet peeve about this show. And to think I absolutely loved her addition to the show at first.

Idk what to say about this show in general. Season 1 and 2 are all time greats, one episode after the other being masterpieces of television.

Escapism into a make-believe world where everything is symmetrical, colour coded and everyone blinks and tilts their head perfectly on cue. But that is hardly a crime, is it? In a world that is often bitter and cruel, or plagued by unrest and war, a little escape is often all one has.¬†This is a theme that is very prevalent in the movie, throughout all its timelines, and, I believe, a need in our own real world that Wes Anderson‚Äôs movies are very happy to fill themselves.¬†Escapism is certainly not a crime, sometimes it‚Äôs even a necessity.

also, <b>Captain</b>¬†Jack Sparrow is one of the greatest snd most memorable movie characters ever, Johnny Depp is simply amazing, same as Geoffrey Rush!!

what to do with this one?
yes it probably has the funniest action sequences ever and insanely cool creature design and well-looking CGI (by modern standards even!!), but there are really weird characters decisions that I just can‚Äôt wrap my head around. That whole Elizabeth x Jack subplot came completely out of nowhere?? and what was her arc in this movie again despite that? alright yeah, nothing at all! More,¬†why on earth did Norrington decide to abandon his mission to get the key and fight Will instead, just for the lolz??? this is crucial for the entire wheel scene!! there are a few of those here and there that just made me shake my head so hard that I didn‚Äôt enjoy it as much as I would‚Äôve liked.


And then Davy Jones: what a villain. what an absolute bleak stand in of a villain. I know the 3rd movie will give him some much needed characterisation but I am not judging the 3rd movie, I‚Äôm judging this one.
He just exists, like a stand in for later. The movie just doesn‚Äôt have time to give him any depth yet. Just evil for evil‚Äôs sake here, all the explaining and storytelling happens in another movie.¬†A vast contrast to Barbossa, who was phenomenal in the first film. Davy Jones looks cooler ig, have to give him that.


And lastly, the obvious sequel setup just makes it feel a bit incomplete :/¬†¬†there‚Äôs no resolution to any of the characters arcs at all

hm, maybe i‚Äôll feel different about it after I‚Äôve seen the 3rd one.

I don‚Äôt mind a movie that slowly builds up tension, but this movie didn‚Äôt. It opened with 2 very intense scenes and then there was nothing happening for a whole. hour. (I checked my watch, and that‚Äòs not a good sign). It is then very intense for the rest of the runtime, but without a proper buildup. I loved the second half and I loved how the movie got its message abroad (which, again, it did really really well). But I can‚Äôt overlook the first half which really didn‚Äôt give me any enjoyment at all and which also didn‚Äôt pay off later in the film in any major way.

Also, as an autistic person, I have 2 more problems with this:
First, Turing was never described as showing autistic behaviours by his peers, so I am very unsure where this came from, and it feels very weird to me to be honest. Again, Turing deserves a real biopic. No need to tell a story that wasn‚Äôt. (Not even to mention the horribly stereotypical portrayal of autism in this movie. Seriously, it‚Äôs bad.)
Second, Benedict Cumberbatch is really the last person who I feel good about portraying an autistic-coded character. He‚Äôs showed some real ableist ideas about autism in interviews, which probably explains parts the aforementioned stereotypical portrayal.
All in all this leaves a bitter taste in my mouth.

There is definitely a lot going on in this movie, both actually and thematically, but it all kind of works together. My biggest issue is with the backstory of the characters in the bathhouse, I felt like those weren‚Äôt explored properly, which made some of their scenes feel not that emotionally deep and just sticking out in general.

I‚Äòm scared to ‚Äúannounce‚Äù this to my friends or closer circles bc I have this notion in my brain that I HAVE to get it right immediately. I‚Äôve told one other person who assured me that‚Äôs bs (which I already knew) but it still feels scary to me idk

B√©la feels good rn? it checks all the boxes tbh.
I wanted a name that‚Äôs easy to understand, preferably neutral (B√©la is a male Hungarian name but apparently female in Slovakia, and historically there have been both male and female B√©las in the Austrian name registers, I checked). I also wanted to like the meaning of it, and B√©la means ‚Äúguts‚Äù, ‚Äúinnards‚Äù, which I honestly love üò≠
I also didn‚Äôt want to pick a name from a culture that I have nothing to do with (no offence to anyone who‚Äôs doing that, I get that especially neutral names are almost impossible to find in most languages outside english, it‚Äôs just not for me personally), but I feel okay with picking a Hungarian name since part of my heritage is Hungarian.

okay but this was really personal and heartfelt and progressive (for the 50s)! Sure there are issues and clumsy speech and outdated ideas. I‚Äôve seen many people (rightfully) criticise the ending, when the movie tries to argue for a ‚Äúcure‚Äù. From what I‚Äôve read, the movie had to adopt that bc it would‚Äôve otherwise been unreleasable bc it would‚Äôve never passed the censor‚Äôs board, which apparently demanded movies to have a (very traditional) ‚Äúhappy ending‚Äù for the main character.
That makes a lot of sense to me, especially when you add that in the middle of the movie it‚Äôs stated multiple times that trans people are not interested in getting ‚Äúcured‚Äù and the way to go is an affirmative lifestyle and/or gender-affirming surgery. I believe this to be the true message of the movie.¬†

With that in mind, idk what to tell you, this one is a clear 5/5 for me. such a deeply personal tale, compellingly brought to the screen. yes, this movie is eccentric and abandons clear plotlines almost immediately but that all works in its favour.

I remember being very frustrated by this truly stupid decision, and kind of angry for truly fucking Django and Broomhilda over as well when I first saw this movie years ago. But now I see, the movie only works if Schultz dies. Django has to be fucked over by him. Because at the end, this is his story. He is Siegfried. It has to be him who saves Hildi, not Schultz. It has to be him who takes revenge on everyone at Candyland, not Schultz. It has to be him who fights for his place in the world, not Schultz. And seeing his transformation from the very first scene to the very last, he has proven himself just as powerful and capable alone as with Schultz. And isn‚Äôt that what this film is all about?

side note: ofc Schultz is a white saviour character, but narratively I kinda like how him (thoughtlessly, but still) royally fucking Django over proves that he can‚Äôt even rely on the least racist man in all of the southern states to not put a gigantic spoke in his wheel",,2024-05-10

In this case, the story of a WW2 kamikaze fighter pilot who deserted and survived the war, fighting survivors guilt ever since, which gets embodied by the titular monster. Godzilla as a character (in the hands of competent writers) has this ability to become whatever the story needs him to be, be it a metaphor for guilt, nuklear weapons, nature itself or even bureaucratical incompetence. And this is why I come back for every movie, hoping to see at least glimmers in the character. Toho (as expected) fucking nails is here, again. Can‚Äôt wait for the next* one.

</i>
Ich mag Dokus √ºber interessante Leute, und ich mag generell Filme die in ihrem Genre eine unkonventionelle oder mutige Herangehensweise w√§hlen. Beides ist hier ja zweifellos erf√ºllt.
‚ÄûDer Soldat Monika‚Äú ist eine Doku die ihren Zuschauer*innen vertraut, das gesehene weitestgehend selbst einordnen zu k√∂nnen, indem sie bewusst nur selten bis gar nicht Aussagen versucht zu kontextualisieren. Um ehrlich zu sein kann ich mir nicht vorstellen, dass ein Film √ºber Monika Donner anders √ºberhaupt funktionieren k√∂nnte, ohne dadurch etwas an seiner Komplexit√§t einzub√º√üen.
Der Film schafft es sehr gut, die Person Monika Donner mit allen ihren Facetten darzustellen, und gleichzeitig die vermeintliche Diskrepanz in ihrem Weltbild aufzul√∂sen bzw dessen etwas n√§her zu kommen. Gleichzeitig ist es auch nicht immer leicht zu schaun wenn mit dem T-Slur um sich geworfen wird oder der Holocaust f√ºr extrem unpassende Vergleiche relativiert wird. Am Ende ist es eben ein Film √ºber durchschnittliche Gespr√§che zwischen durchschnittlichen √ñsterreichern.
Inszeniert wird das ganze in einer wilden Mischung von echt aufgenommen Szenen, Interviews, nachgespielte Szenen ihres Lebens, Animationseinlagen, abstrakte Kampfszenen, und (grandiose) Musik-Performances von der Band ‚ÄûGewalt‚Äú. Es ist eine Doku wie sie keine andere ist, und irgendwie funktioniert es.¬†
Wor√ºber ich mir aber noch unklar bin ist, was und ob es aus diesem Film etwas was √ºber eine Charakterdarstellung Monika Donners hinaus geht mitzunehmen gibt. Ich tendiere zu eher nein.


<i>english version:
</i>I like documentaries about interesting people, and I generally like films that take an unconventional or bold approach to their genre. Both are undoubtedly fulfilled here.
""Der Soldat Monika"" is a documentary that trusts its viewers to be able to classify what they see for themselves as far as possible by deliberately making little to no attempt to contextualise statements. To be honest, I can't imagine that a film about Monika Donner could work any other way without losing some of its complexity.
The film manages very well to portray Monika Donner as a person with all her facets and at the same time to resolve the supposed discrepancy in her world view or to get a little closer to it. At the same time, it is not always easy to watch when the T-slur is thrown around or the Holocaust is relativised for extremely inappropriate comparisons. In the end, it is a film about average conversations between average Austrians.
The whole thing is staged in a wild mixture of real recorded scenes, interviews, re-enacted scenes of her life, animated interludes, abstract fight scenes and (amazing) music performances by the band ""Gewalt"". It's a documentary like no other, and somehow it works.¬†
But what I'm still unclear about is what and if there is anything to take away from this film beyond a character portrayal of Monika Donner. I tend to think no.","nonstop :), with kai, with friends, in cinema, queer, schikaneder",2025-05-09

No but really, at least one of those really was a nice touch. This movie is written so intelligently, you can tell Bong researched the subject and knows exactly what he wants to critique. People seem to be divided on the over-the-top satirical performances, especially by Jake Gyllenhaal, and less so by Tilda Swinton. What can I say, for me they worked, yes the characters are somewhat one-dimensional but it's supposed to be a satire, not a realistic depiction. Does the movie have flaws, of course, but overall its a banger. Two to three scenes that are really difficult to watch (by intention ofc) Okja is precious, and so is Mija. Jake Gyllenhaal is an absolute blast everytime he is on screen.

¬†At one hand it is an excellent horror comedy, and I wanna really highlight the comedy elements, this movie was FUNNY, honestly I‚Äòve never laughed at a film as much this year as I laughed at this, I wish we got more horror comedies again! great and fun
On the other hand, the horror elements were pretty lackluster in the first half and completely fell apart in the second after the reveal. I won‚Äôt spoil anything, but I don‚Äôt think this movie even needed a reveal at all. Unnecessary and ruins all the dynamic and mystery the movie had going on.

2025-08-21,Predator: Killer of Killers,2025,https://boxd.it/aO3aPJ,3,,"Question for the culture: Are we supposed to think the Yautja are cool? My biggest qualm with every predator movie so far was always that the movie tries to portray them as these honourable hunters that live by a codex and only hunt the strongest species out there when in reality they are the biggest species of cowards imaginable. They are more than 10 times more technologically advanced than any species they hunt. Thats the equivalent of me going in the woods and shooting at deer with an assault rifle. Okay?? Am I meant to think this is cool and honourable? I‚Äòm watching a cat toying with their captured birds. Only Yautja that were respectable were the ones in the AVP franchise, bc Xenomorphs are actually a worthy adversary.

Anyway, I needed to get this out of the way. This movie was‚Ä¶. okay! Painfully okay! The action is great and the animation as well, but good action does not make a good movie if the story is underdeveloped. I have to admit, the second half was a lot better than the first, ‚ÄùThe Gun‚Äú storyline and the finale after had me emotionally invested in the characters (finally?) bc in the first have I honestly could not care less about these people. We saw too little of them to get invested, especially in the samurai story line. Anyway, ending was okay, most random reveal of an iconic old item imaginable (iykyk), and kind of dooming lore drop in the last minute. Don‚Äòt know if I enjoy the implications.¬†
Anyway, final thoughts, Yautja are dumb, I find them annoying and I cheered for every one that got killed by our main cast in this movie üëçüèª I think that‚Äôs worth a star each at least

I really tried to like it but this movie is just so BORING. Just putting two iconic movie monsters together in the same movie is not enough, but AVP believes it is, bc it spends no energy in trying to craft an engaging story or well-defined characters. Apart from Weyland (and fuck this movie for making me sympathise with a CEO), none of these characters have any motivation, or if they do, they are immediately killed off once we hit the 30 minute mark, without delving any deeper into anything. What‚Äòs the point of having 10 characters if we kill them all instantly anyway? The Xenomorphs are great, every time they were on screen I had a good time for a few minutes, but that‚Äôs about it sadly.

Apart from that though, this movie ROCKED
I had a blast from the first minute to the last. The whole movie is clearly an homage to Ridley Scott‚Äòs original film from 1979, and yeah, there might have been a few too many callbacks, and some of the characters were underutilised, but who cares. The movie looks beautiful, the atmosphere is great, and the tense moments are amazing. The third act still managed to scare me on the second watch, simply amazing. It‚Äôs the Alien renaissance right now, and I‚Äòm living for it. Romulus 2 can‚Äôt come fast enough.

A thought that I had while watching this film is, I find it interesting on what different themes the Alien movies focus depending on their release dates. The original Alien had a class element to it, but Romulus is a lot more bold and doomy with it. A curious bit of info, on the 1999 DVD commentary to the original 1979‚Äôs Alien, Ridley Scott stated that they imagined the detail of companies being more influential than countries in the future for their movie‚Äôs timeline, but it wasn‚Äôt a thing in 1979 just yet. Now we‚Äôre living in that time. Here in Romulus Weyland-Yutani owns the whole mining colony like slaves, in Alien: Earth WY and other companies have divided the whole planet between themselves. It‚Äòs a natural evolution of themes, which I enjoy. This movie also focuses a lot more and AI ethics and what it means to be a human, much in the spirit of Prometheus. I‚Äòm curious to see how these themes will evolve and differ in this franchise in the future.

Also they better have nominated David Jonsson for an award of some sorts for this, great performance!",simping for rain btw,2025-08-23
