Position,Name,Year,URL,Description
1,Aliens,1986,https://boxd.it/29PA,<p>insane movie and insanely good sequel!!</p><p><br></p><p>also i have yet to see the extended cut which is supposed to be even better</p>
2,Alien,1979,https://boxd.it/2awY,"the only reason this is #2 is bc I just enjoy the expanded lore of Aliens a bit more, but they are both insane masterpieces and they only both stand on the same level. This is one of THE best horror movies ever, I LOVE everything about it and the Xenomorph (although not yet named in this film) is probably my favourite movie monster to ever exist"
3,Blade Runner 2049,2017,https://boxd.it/b8wK,"I went INSANE when I first saw this, this is IMO the most well-crafted sequel to ever exist! It manages to execute the <i>very hard</i>&nbsp;task of feeling both modern and not out of place with the original <i>perfectly. </i>I almost couldnâ€™t believe it."
4,Blade Runner,1982,https://boxd.it/2bcA,"insane movie what do I have to say. up until now every single movie is a masterpiece. for as bad and dreadful as this franchise is as a whole, the heights were <b>real heights</b>"
5,Predator,1987,https://boxd.it/2b84,just simply a very good action movie. the cool creature design carries it a lot tho tbh. I wouldnâ€™t call it a masterpiece but itâ€™s very very good.&nbsp;
6,Prey,2022,https://boxd.it/sNBU,also REALLY GOOD. the first predator sequel that actually is on the same level as the original. well done.
7,AlienÂ³,1992,https://boxd.it/20zS,"<p>Look. I couldnâ€™t possibly bring myself to actually rank this one higher, even tho it is (controversial take incoming) probably my favourite of all the alien movies. <b>WHAT DO I MEAN BY THIS: </b>Donâ€™t get me wrong please, this movie is <i>not good.</i>&nbsp;Itâ€™s bad even. very bad. But there was <i>so much </i>potential here, and in my head there exists a version of this that is free of flaws and that actually stands in line with Alien and Aliens, creating a perfect trilogy. Sadly, this isnâ€™t what we got, and what we got has a LONG list of tiny and severe shortcomings, so that I have to objectively say this isnâ€™t a good film. But boy what it could have been. THE FEW HEIGHTS HERE ARE SO GOOD THO LIKE SO GOOD<br></p>"
8,Alien: Romulus,2024,https://boxd.it/zGqO,"third act fuckign <i>CARRIES</i>&nbsp;ðŸ˜©<br>the first truly great sequel after the first 2 (3), great tense moments and new ideas, pls give me more<br>"
9,Predators,2010,https://boxd.it/1d9m,"until the release of Prey this was the only worthy predator sequel simply bc it dared to change things up, which paid off imo"
10,The Predator,2018,https://boxd.it/bDw2,controversial opinion again I think this was <i>okay</i>. It wanted to be a comedy and it wasnâ€™t a <i>good</i>&nbsp;comedy but it was an OKAY comedy. itâ€™s a bad film but itâ€™s still overhated idc
11,Aliens vs Predator: Requiem,2007,https://boxd.it/2ans,another controversial opinion ðŸ˜­ i enjoyed this one<br>yes it has less lore than the original AvP and YES ITS DARK I KNOW but it was entertaining? the original AvP kinda bored me
12,Alien: Covenant,2017,https://boxd.it/49UY,"oh boy oh god the ridley scott sequels also scream of lost potential, davids lore is the only worthwhile thing in these films. also i wish they just wouldnâ€™t completely retcon the xenomorph lifecycle and evolution every single time. also these movies donâ€™t know what they are about. like focus on one part pls. this one does it slightly better than promethues tho"
13,AVP: Alien vs. Predator,2004,https://boxd.it/2atU,fun! but not as entertaining as AvP:R idc<br>the lore is amazing in this tho
14,Prometheus,2012,https://boxd.it/2s9e,"ehhhh this movie has no idea what it wants to be, tonally all over the place. david is a sick character iâ€˜ll have to give it that"
15,Predator 2,1990,https://boxd.it/2aY4,"just didnâ€™t resonate with me, the concept is cool tho tbf. i know people love this one and iâ€™m in the minory for kinda disliking it but thatâ€™s okay"
16,Alien Resurrection,1997,https://boxd.it/20zI,"<p>no go away i could barely finish this I HAVE AN OWN SEPARATE <a href=""https://boxd.it/cG2b4"" title=""WORST MOVIE EVER LIST"">WORST MOVIE EVER LIST</a> WHICH THIS MOVIE INSPIRED ME TO CREATE ðŸ˜­<br><br>idkkkk itâ€™s campy so I <i>get</i>&nbsp;why people like it but it just didnâ€™t resonate with me AT ALL. also ripleys ark was finished after Alien3, and clone ripley SUCKS as a character. winona ryder is the ONLY plus here</p>"
