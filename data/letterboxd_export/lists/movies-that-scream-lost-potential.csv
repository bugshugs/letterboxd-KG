1,Event Horizon,1997,https://boxd.it/20d8,"god, everything about it. this could have been THE MOVIE but we only got to see a fraction of it. anyway, unrelated but who‘s gonna travel to transylvania with me? I‘ve got some, uhm, buisness to do in some salt mines"
2,Alien³,1992,https://boxd.it/20zS,"my favourite alien movie, but arguably the worst of the trilogy (the 4th doesn’t exist pls and thank you)
this could have been phenomenal, and I like to pretend that it is :)"
3,Spider-Man 3,2007,https://boxd.it/2a7Y,"self-explanatory, this movie is a mess. there is a lot of good stuff in it tho, it’s just hidden under layers and layers of mess"
